  I've used Java for almost three years, and many of my projects are written in Java, ranging from reverse engineering to compilers.
  I've been also using Kotlin for around three years for mostly the same reasons.
  
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) ![Groovy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Groovy-5E97B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=Apache%20Groovy&logoColor=white)
  
  I've worked with Groovy a fair bit for some private projects and an old version of ModernProtobuf, now Groovy is no longer used. 
  I've also used Python for many medium-sized private projects, mainly around web scraping and automation.

- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) ![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
  
  I've had to learn Javascript and Typescript to contribute to some open-source projects.

- ![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-0175C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white)

  I've used Dart for Flutter.
  Talking about Flutter, I've used it on Desktop development.
  You can check the Phantom repo if you want to try a publicly available program for Windows that follows the FluentUI spec developed using Flutter Desktop.

- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
  
  After a couple of years of using only Java, I learned C++ when I became interested in CS.
